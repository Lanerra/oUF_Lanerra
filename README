A simple unit frame addon based off of the oUF core framework. The design and purpose of these unit
frames is to allow as much configuration as possible via an attached configuration lua to alter
certain settings of the unit frames, while remaining as light on memory usage as possible.

It also has a toggle-able 'healer mode' that alters the location of the raid and party frames
dependent on whether the "Healer" option has been toggled to true in the config for party or raid.

-----------
Please Note
-----------

Some knowledge of Lua is required for customization of these frames beyond the configuration file.
To alter options in the configuration file, simple open it in your favorite text editor and change
options from false to true, or vice versa. Also of note, for the displaying of health, more than
one health option cannot be functional at a time so please choose only one.
